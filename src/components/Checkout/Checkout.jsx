    [x] create click handler for checkout
    [ ] POST data to the server
[ ] After the checkout is complete, navigate the user back to the select pizza page AND clear out the reducers as appropriate.
    [ ] .then() should link user back to <PizzaList />
    [ ] clear reducers for cart and Checkout
